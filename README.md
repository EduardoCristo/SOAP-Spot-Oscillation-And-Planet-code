**SOAPv4** (*Spot Oscillation And Planet*) is an open-source Python package that simulates the impact of stellar activity and planetary transits on spectroscopic, radial velocity, and photometric data. Accurate modeling of stellar features like spots and faculae is essential for robust exoplanet characterization, particularly with high-resolution spectroscopy.

Initially built to reproduce the radial velocity effects of stellar spots, SOAP has broadened its scope across multiple versions. **SOAPv4** now integrates a wide set of physical processes and observational configurations.

### INSTALLATION

SOAP is written Python.
To install run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduardoCristo/SOAP-Spot-Oscillation-And-Planet-code
cd SOAP-Spot-Oscillation-And-Planet-code

pip install -e .
```

then you can use SOAP from Python with:

```bash
import SOAP
```
